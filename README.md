# Frontend Mentor - E-commerce product page solution

This is our solution to the [E-commerce product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6).<br>
We built it as a group of three, as part of our HTML/CSS/Javascript workshop learning.

### The challenge
Originally the project description had these requirements;

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

We also added these functionalities;
- Entire project was made with screensize 1440x900 and 375x900 for mobile.
- Cart pops up for three seconds as a new item is added
- Queued and actual cart quantities cannot go below zero
- Added various links to the navbar(and checkout button)
- Customized the user profile to our personal humour
